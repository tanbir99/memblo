# memblo
## In Progress!

memblo is an application that will allow for me to ditch my school planner, so I can keep track of all my assignments directly on my computer. 

I am using Angular for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end. The database I have decided to use is PostgreSQL. What I have created so far in the back-end is currently deployed via Heroku.

I am currently in the process of implementing middleware in the back-end to manage user sessions.
